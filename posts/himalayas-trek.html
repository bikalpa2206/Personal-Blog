                <p>The 4AM wakeup call was brutal. My headlamp cut through the pitch-black trail as we began the steep ascent to Poon Hill. Each step in the freezing air felt like a small victory.</p>
                
                <h2>The Climb</h2>
                <p>At 3,210 meters, the thin air made every switchback more challenging. Our guide, Raj, kept saying "Bistarai, bistarai" (slowly, slowly) - the unofficial motto of Himalayan treks.</p>
                
                <p>What kept me going:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The promise of hot chai at the top</li>
                    <li>The growing glow behind the mountains</li>
                    <li>The camaraderie with fellow hikers</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>The Reward</h2>
                <p>Then suddenly - the first golden rays hit Dhaulagiri. One by one, the Annapurna range ignited in alpenglow. The entire valley below us was still in shadow, making the peaks look like they were floating.</p>

                <p>In that moment, all the aching muscles and sleep deprivation melted away. This is why we trek - for these fleeting moments where nature takes your breath away (literally and figuratively).</p>
                
                <h3>Practical Tips</h3>
                <p>If you're planning this trek:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start training stairs with a weighted pack</li>
                    <li>Pack layers - it's freezing at dawn but warms quickly</li>
                    <li>Bring extra camera batteries (they drain fast in the cold)</li>
                </ol>
